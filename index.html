            <p>It was until the company entered post world war II manufacturing in 1946 that Roll-Royce began to build and sell entire cars.Rolls-Royce has remained one of the most famous names in engineering throughout the world, find out more about our
                history and the keys milestones that have helped shape us.Success with the cars led to the formation of the Rolls-Royce company in March 1906 and to the launch of the six-cylinder Silver Ghost which, within a year, was hailed as 'the best
                car in the world'.</p>

                <p>Rolls-Royce had an early foray to make aeroplane engines. It was built in 1915 and was the first engine to amke a nonstop trans-Atlantic crossing. It supplied over half of the total air horsepower used by allies in the world war I.</p>
                <p>The late 1920s saw us develop the 'R' engine to power Britain's entry in the International Schneider Trophy seaplane contest.</p>
                <p>It established a new world air speed record of over 400mph in 1931.</p>
                <p>The Merlin powered the Hawker Hurricane and Supermarine Spitfire in the Battle of Britain. Demand for the Merlin during the Second World War transformed us from a relatively small company into a major contender in aero propulsion.</p>

                <p>The Commercial Managing Director Claude Johnson had an early example model finished in silver and named, as if it were a yatch, Silver Ghost. </p>
                <p>The press picked up and used Silver Ghost for all the 40/50 cars until the introduction of the 40/50 Phantom in 1925.</p>

                <p>After world war I,Rolls-Royce successfully avoided attempts to encourage British car manufacturers to merge.</p>
                <p>Faced with falling sales of the 40/50 Silver Ghost in short-lived but deep postwar slumps Rolls-Royce introduced the smaller, cheaper Twenty in 1922 ending the one-model policy followed since 1908.</p>

                <h4><strong>Rolls-Royce VII</strong></h4>
                <p>Two companies with a long-held interest in Rolls-Royce were German manufacturers Volkswagen and BMW.</p>
                <p>Rolls-Royce Motor Cars was sold by Vickers to Volkswagen, although BMW hold the rights to the name and the marque for use on Rolls-Royce cars, having acquired the rights from Rolls-Royce plc for £40m in 1998.</p>
                <p>This interest came in fruition in 1998 when BMW outbid Volkswagen(430 million Euros over 430 million Euros) in an attempt toacquire the Rolls-Royce brand.</p>
                <p>The outcome of this bidding war was that BMW owned the Rolls-Royce name and logo while Volkswagen had rights to the mascot and grill.</p>

                <p>They took full control of our oil and gas joint venture, Cooper Rolls, with the acquisition of the rotating compression equipment interests of Cooper Energy Services. </p>
                <p>They also acquired National Airmotive in California, a major repair and overhaul facility now part of Rolls-Royce Engine Services.</p>
                <p>The 1990s ended with the £576m acquisition of Vickers plc which, with primarily the Ulstein and Kamewa products and capabilities joining the our existing gas turbine activities, transformed us into the global leader in marine power systems.</p>
                <p>This stalemate was broken when a deal was made that, from 2003 on, BMW was allowed to produce the complete car under the Rolls-Royce name.</p>
                <p>The 2003 Phantom VII was the first Rolls-Royce built completely under BMW.</p>
