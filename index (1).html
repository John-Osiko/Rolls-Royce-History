      <p id="two">Sir. Fredrick Henry Royce started an electrical and mechanical business in 1884.He made his first car, a two-cylinder Royce 10hp, in his Manchester factory in 1904. Henry Royce was introduced to Charles Stewart Rolls at the Midland Hotel on 4 March 1906. From this collaboration thus the birth of the name.</p>

      <h4><strong>A History of Rolls-Royce in 3 Cars</strong></h4>
      <p id="concept">It was until the company entered post world war II manufacturing in 1946 that Roll-Royce began to build and sell entire cars.</p>

        <p>Rolls-Royce had an early foray to make aeroplane engines. It was built in 1915 and was the first engine to amke a nonstop trans-Atlantic crossing. It supplied over half of the total air horsepower used by allies in the world war I.</p>

        <p>The Commercial Managing Director Claude Johnson had an early example model finished in silver and named, as if it were a yatch, Silver Ghost. Unofficially the press picked up and used Silver Ghost for all the 40/50 cars until the introduction of the 40/50 Phantom in 1925.</p>

        <p>After world war I,Rolls-Royce successfully avoided attempts to encourage British car manufacturers to merge. Faced with falling sales of the 40/50 Silver Ghost in short-lived but deep postwar slumps Rolls-Royce introduced the smaller, cheaper Twenty in 1922 ending the one-model policy followed since 1908.</p>

        <h5><strong>Rolls-Royce VII</strong></h5>
        <p>Two companies with a long-held interest in Rolls-Royce were German manufacturers Volkswagen and BMW. This interest came in fruition in 1998 when BMW outbid Volkswagen(430 million Euros over 430 million Euros) in an attempt toacquire the Rolls-Royce brand. The outcome of this bidding war was that BMW owned the Rolls-Royce name and logo while Volkswagen had rights to the mascot and grill.</p>

        <p>This stalemate was broken when a deal was made that, from 2003 on, BMW was allowed to produce the complete car under the Rolls-Royce name. The 2003 Phantom VII was the first Rolls-Royce built completely under BMW.</p>
